Custom Notifications and Alerts is a versatile WordPress plugin designed to enable site administrators to create and manage custom notifications that appear on the front end of their website. This plugin enhances user communication by allowing targeted messages to specific user roles and even to guest visitors.

Key Features:
Customizable Messages: Administrators can easily compose and update custom notification messages directly from the WordPress admin dashboard. This feature allows for timely updates and announcements to be communicated effectively to site visitors.

Notification Types: The plugin supports different types of notifications such as Info, Warning, and Error. Each type can be styled differently to convey the urgency or importance of the message.

Targeted Delivery: Notifications can be targeted to specific user roles within the WordPress ecosystem. This functionality ensures that messages are relevant and reach the intended audience, whether they are administrators, editors, authors, subscribers, or custom user roles.

Guest User Notifications: In addition to logged-in users, the plugin offers the option to display notifications to guest users who visit the site. This capability is useful for broadcasting announcements or alerts to all site visitors.

Dismissible Notifications: Users have the option to dismiss notifications using a convenient dismiss button. This feature enhances user experience by allowing them to clear notifications that are no longer relevant or useful.

Responsive Design: Notifications are designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring they display correctly across various devices and screen sizes.

Custom Styling: The plugin includes customizable CSS styles for notifications, enabling site administrators to match the look and feel of notifications with their site's design and branding.

Activation and Deactivation Hooks: The plugin includes hooks for activation and deactivation, ensuring seamless integration with WordPress and proper initialization of default settings upon activation.

How It Works:
Installation: Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and activate it through the WordPress admin dashboard.
